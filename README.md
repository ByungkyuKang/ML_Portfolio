🤖 Machine Learning Projects


🧩 Titanic Survival Prediction

- Location: Machine_Learning_Projects/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/notebooks/titanic_analysis.ipynb

- A classic entry-level machine learning project exploring the Titanic passenger dataset.
  

This notebook includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing with pandas

- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn

- Insights into survival factors such as gender, age, and passenger class


🧠 Goal: Gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

📊 Dataset: Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

🧰 Personal Projects

🖼️ Unique Image Organizer (Python-based Tool)

Location: Personal_Projects/Unique_Img_Process_with_Python/

Helper to Organize Images.

This program is a Python-based application designed to simplify personal photo management.
It groups similar or identical images by inserting a series of numbers at the beginning of their names, making it easier to manage duplicates efficiently.

Key features:

- Groups similar images into numbered sets

- Supports directory scanning and image comparison

- Renames images consistently for easy organization

Tech Stack: Python, Pillow, OS library, Tkinter (for file selection UI)


🌐 Information Scraper (In Progress)

Location: Personal_Projects/Infomation_Scraper/main.py

A simple web scraping tool that will collect and structure useful data from selected websites.
Currently under development — the foundation script (main.py) is initialized and being expanded with BeautifulSoup and Requests.

🧠 Goal: Learn the fundamentals of web scraping, request handling, and data parsing.
