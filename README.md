🤖 Machine Learning Projects

  🧩 Titanic Survival Prediction
    - Location: Machine_Learning_Projects/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/notebooks/titanic_analysis.ipynb
    - A classic entry-level machine learning project exploring the Titanic passenger dataset.
  
  This notebook includes:
    - Data loading and preprocessing with pandas
    - Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn

  Insights into survival factors such as gender, age, and passenger class

  🧠 Goal: Gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

  📊 Dataset: Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

🧰 Personal Projects

&nbsp;&nbsp;🖼️ Unique Image Organizer (Python-based Tool)

  Location: Personal_Projects/Unique_Img_Process_with_Python/

  Helper to Organize Images.
  This program is a Python-based application designed to simplify personal photo management.
  It groups similar or identical images by inserting a series of numbers at the beginning of their names, making it easier to manage duplicates efficiently.

  Key features:
    - Groups similar images into numbered sets
    - Supports directory scanning and image comparison
    - Renames images consistently for easy organization

  Tech Stack: Python, Pillow, OS library, Tkinter (for file selection UI)

  🌐 Information Scraper (In Progress)

  Location: Personal_Projects/Infomation_Scraper/main.py

  A simple web scraping tool that will collect and structure useful data from selected websites.
  Currently under development — the foundation script (main.py) is initialized and being expanded with BeautifulSoup and Requests.

  🧠 Goal: Learn the fundamentals of web scraping, request handling, and data parsing.
